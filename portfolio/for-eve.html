      <h1>For Eve</h1>
      <p>
          A kinetic sculpture exploring the process of healing. The idea came from my friend Eve’s metaphor: “Imagine a tree growing over concrete. The concrete becomes part of the tree, and the tree keeps growing. We can't picture this tree without the concrete anymore as it has grown fully around it."
        <br/>
      </p>
      <p>
          The sculpture was built out of acrylic tubing, origami and a motor with copper-wire attached. As the motor turned, it slowly pushed those wire filaments through the branches of the tree. The wires would gradually nudge the origami farther out of the tubes, causing them to bloom and then eventually fall out.
        </p>
