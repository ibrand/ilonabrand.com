      <h1>For Eve</h1>
      <p>
        A kinetic sculptural exploration of the process of healing. Inspired by a friend's analogy: Imagine a tree growing over concrete. The tree can't remove the concrete, but the tree doesn't stop growing. There is no broken if there is no fixed. There is only a non linear timeline of healing. Growth will not happen straight, it will happen in every direction.
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Materials: Acrylic tubing, copper wire, stepper motor, arduino + easy driver, origami paper</i>
      </p>
      <p>
          For Eve was displayed at the School for Poetic Computationâ€™s final student showcase. Slowly the copper wires inside the clear tube would push the origami pieces in the tubes until they bloomed like flowers and eventually fell out.
